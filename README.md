# Business Analytics(Visualization Project using Tableau Public)

**Project Description**

In this project, you'll create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. You will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

**US Census Demographic Data**
This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it includes the census data for all counties in 2015.

You are required to create three visualizations. Some questions you may attempt to answer include those pertaining to the following areas:

**Which states have the best transportation?**
This is a fairly subjective question, so your first job is to define what the best transportation is. Is it highest percentage of transit use? Is it lowest mean commute times. Then you need to determine how to aggregate the data from the county level to the state. Are there outlier counties affecting the data? How should you aggregate all the data from the counties to represent the state effectively? Please provide your reasoning in your report.

**How does income and poverty look across America?**
Think about how best to contrast this data to show an interesting finding. You can look across many of the different fields to show interesting findings. Do counties with more construction experience more or less poverty? Do counties near the coast experiene more or less income? Remember this is all correlation and not causation so we cannot say any one thing causes it but we can report descriptive statistics.

**You can also come up with your own question!**
As you work with the data, come up with a question you're curious about and can be answered from the data. Build a dashboard or story to answer your question and lead viewers to that answer.In my case study, I have the idea “Total number of employees (women and men) by state in America”
